I am current a graduate student in computer science at The University of Texas at Dallas. Previously,  I completed my undergraduate in chemical engineering from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. 

It was my professional life that made me curious about the mathematics behind machine learning. I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at [i3systems](http://www.i3systems.in/) where I got to experiment with "messy" data from the healthcare industry.
I am loving the coursework in computer science and plan on taking more challenging courses in the upcoming semester. I also started with my master's thesis under Dr. Jessica Ouyang where I am working on automatically generating relation work section in research papers.  

In my leisure time I love to spend time going out and hiking. I also love exploring music and always looking for recommendations for the same. Check me out on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/21u5vb34jvu5ehdvwtb3l4rlq)
