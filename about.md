Update January 2021: I started with my Master's in computer science at The University of Texas at Dallas.   
I worked as a Senior Data Scientist at [i3systems](http://www.i3systems.in/). I am particularly interested in the mathematics behind Machine Learning. I also have a degree in chemical engineering from IIT Bombay.

For the past three years, I have worked on a range of problems in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I also love taking pictures, exploring movies and reading.


I love to explore different kinds of music.
