Hi, I am Biswadip, currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at [i3systems](http://www.i3systems.in/). I am particularly interested in the mathematics behind Machine Learning. I did my B Tech from IIT Bombay.

For the past three years, I have worked on a range of problems in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I also love taking pictures, exploring music and movies and reading.
